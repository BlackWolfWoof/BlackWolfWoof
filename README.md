<summary>My fursona (furry persona)</summary>

- **Name:** Black Wolf  
- **Species:** Wolf  
- **Subspecies:** Eurasian wolf  
- **Gender:** None  
- **Personality:** A friendly wolf that likes to help everyone reach their goals. He is open and welcome to new people and likes to come in contact with everyone.
Hugging and cuddling is always allowed. He also bites bad people and protects others :3
- **About:** This fursona is a representation of my real me and also of the one I'd like to be. It can vary and change over time as it represents myself.
I chose the species & name because my I like wolves. I also like the darkness & the color black and thats why I decided to also include that in my name to make it more unique.
